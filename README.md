![quadcopter_image]

## Description

The idea behind this thesis is to create a quadcopter that a user could control it through WIFI. At this stage the quadcopter has sensors (DHT, Flame detector, Microphone, IR sensor) and a usb camera and it feasible to control it with a browser. The purpose of the sensor is to check out  how they are working on quadcopter and for the future to make more automation task perceive a fire at a forest for example and find the persons which are close and notify the rescue team.I

This is an Arduino YUN application developed during 2017.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you need to set up Arduino YUN with a router or an access point like a mobile phone.
Then you have to put the "io" code at the Arduino YUN and the www folder at the sd card. After that you have to open a browser that the URL of "http://10.2.110.145/sd/" or at the name that you might had give at your Arduino like "http://myarduino.local/".


The application is in a very early age of development but functional.
